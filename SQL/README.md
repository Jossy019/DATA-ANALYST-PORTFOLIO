# Data Analytics with SQL

Welcome to my **Data Analytics with SQL** repository! This project showcases various data analysis tasks and techniques that I have performed using SQL. The goal is to demonstrate how SQL can be used to extract, manipulate, and analyze data to gain meaningful insights and support business decision-making.

## Project Overview

In this repository, you will find a collection of SQL queries and scripts that I have written to perform different types of data analysis tasks. These tasks include data extraction, data cleaning, aggregations, and generating reports. The focus is on applying SQL to real-world data scenarios.

## Contents

- **SQL Queries**: A variety of SQL queries used to solve different data analysis problems.
- **Data Cleaning**: Techniques for transforming and cleaning raw data to make it usable for analysis.
- **Aggregations and Reporting**: SQL queries for aggregating data and generating meaningful reports.
- **Optimization**: Best practices for optimizing SQL queries to handle large datasets efficiently.

## Skills Demonstrated

This repository demonstrates proficiency in the following SQL concepts:
- **Data Selection**: Using `SELECT`, `JOIN`, `WHERE`, and `GROUP BY` to extract relevant data.
- **Aggregation**: Calculating sums, averages, counts, and other aggregate functions.
- **Data Transformation**: Applying SQL functions to clean, convert, and manipulate data.
- **Subqueries & Nested Queries**: Using subqueries to perform more complex analysis.
- **Database Management**: Handling database structures and relationships.
- **Performance Optimization**: Writing efficient queries for large datasets.
